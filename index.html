        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p> I'm a recent graduate of the Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience. I completed my undergraduate degree with a pre-med track, but upon graduation I decided that medical school wasn't for me.
        
        As a neuroscience major, I've learned much about the human nervous system, but my recent coursework has shifted my interests towards healthcare and technology.

        My rich background in neuroscience, physics, and biochemistry has supplemented my experience in the healthcare industry. Additionally, I enjoy problem-solving and working with other people. I'd like to put these skills to use to further any organization that I become a part of.
